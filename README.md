# BetaSafetyMinimizer

Me (and several others) have been annoyed at the fact there's no way to automatically minimize the betasafety backend, so i made this

All it does is on startup, sleep 5 seconds and then keep searching for the first javaw.exe process it can find and minimize it

Feel free to compile it yourself as a new console program
